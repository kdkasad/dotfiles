# Kian's dotfiles

My configuration files.

If you're looking through this repository, use `ls -A` so you can actually see
the dotfiles.

Some of the files here (namely those in `.config/setup/`) are meant to be used with
[my Ansible playbook](https://github.com/kdkasad/mac-dev-playbook) for automatic setup
of a macOS host.
